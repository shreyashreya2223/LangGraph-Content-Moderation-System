# LangGraph-Content-Moderation-System
I built a content moderation system using LangGraph to detect toxic language, spam, and hate speech in user text. It uses keyword checks, assigns severity scores, and decides whether to allow, warn, block, or flag content. The system includes an appeal option and provides clear, explainable results through a step-by-step moderation flow.
